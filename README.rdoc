Systems Check Week 8 at Launch Academy

Simple website that focuses on associations and database structures.

Notes for the future & review:

I've included future years so that this website will not be outdated the instant that new used cars come into rotation. This would be better suited to pull from current date library, but for now just I've just manually included future dates.

This website doesn't actually check if countries exist, so that would be a good thing to change in the future.
